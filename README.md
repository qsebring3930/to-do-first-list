Are you tired of looking at a calendar and being overwhelmed at seeing so many due dates at once? 
Try the to-do first app.

This app allows you to add all your due dates in one place, sorted by completion status and due dates. There is a summary tab at the top that displays your progress and a simplified view of your to-do list, which can be hidden.

This app is special because it emphasizes the absolute NEXT thing that needs to get done in your life. Any time you open the app it only shows you the item with the closest due date!
